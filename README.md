# ticket-and-tow
This is the second story WEBZ has published that examines Chicago’s 37-year old winter parking regulations. 
The first story looked at the effectiveness of the ban. 
This analysis was made using data obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests to the city’s Department of Streets and Sanitation, Department of Finance and Department of Administrative Hearings. 
The Chicago Police Department and the Department of Transportation were also contacted.  
Utilizing parking ticket data, we isolated overnight parking ban violations and geocoded them using the open source Data Science Toolkit. 
Then, utilizing towing records, we filtered overnight parking ban tows and joined the two sets of records together on date and license plate numbers. 
We determined enforcements on and off the overnight ban route, which highlighted the tickets on Grand Avenue that the city said it will refund.
